## How to Use

Simply. 
     
            1. A client or customer walks in, and at checkout, you offer a reward for returning.

            2. You open Shindy, enter their name and email. 

            3. A 'punchcard' is automatically set up for them. 
            
            4. So all you have to do, is search their name or email, and then PUNCH! it!
