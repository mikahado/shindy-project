# Project Template: React/Rails API

## Description

**Note**: 

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v16), and npm
- Render account
- Postgresql

See Environment Setup below for instructions on installing these tools if you
don't already have them.

## Setup

**cloning** 

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:learn-co-curriculum/project-template-react-rails-api.git your-project-name
```

Then, [create a new remote repository][create repo] on GitHub. Head to
[github.com](https://github.com) and click the **+** icon in the top-right
corner and follow the steps to create a new repository. **Important**: don't
check any of the options such as 'Add a README file', 'Add a .gitignore file',
etc. â€” since you're importing an existing repository, creating any of those
files on GitHub will cause issues.

```console

```

When you're ready to start building your project, run:

```sh
bundle install
rails db:create
npm install --prefix client
```

Make sure to also update this README to include documentation about
your project.
