Create a custom route that finds all the punchcards that have a count more than a given number (that was sent as a parameter). Once you have identified all the punchers that meet that requirement, send back all the customers of the punchcards that were identified in your search. Donâ€™t send back any duplicates. Render the customer objects as json. If no punchcards are found render a message that says so.


1. creating a custom route, dynamic paramter, will map to a new action in the punchcards controller
2. in punchcard controller, write action that finds punchcards with number from path
3. return json in action
4. make error handling if no punchcards are found
